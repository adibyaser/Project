## This project relates to the fact separating marginals from dependency structures from two stocks namely: NVIDIA and AMD. Secondly, we plot a simulated transformed data to see if our model resembles the actual plot of the data. Sometimes correlated stocks are held in a portfolio and investor and analyst want to figure out the correlations between the assets. Mostly, correlations only measure linear relationships, excluding non linear one.That is why it's important to consider also the non linear relationships, tail dependencies and estimated distributions to fit around the actual distributions. Copula models thus come into play.Copula models sepearate their marginals from their dependency structure and provide us insightful estimates which is more sophisticated than standard regression.
