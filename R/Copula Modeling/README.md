## This project relates to separating dependency structures from univariate marginal distributions for two stocks namely: NVIDIA and AMD. Secondly, we plot a simulated transformed data to see if our model resembles the actual plot of the data. Sometimes correlated stocks are held in a portfolio. Investors and analysts want to figure out the correlations between the assets. However, correlations only measure linear relationships, excluding non linear ones.That is why it's important to consider the non linear relationships, tail dependencies and estimated distributions to fit around the actual distributions. Copula models thus come into play.Copula models estimate their joint behavior, considering non-linearities as well as provide us with insightful estimates, which is more sophisticated than standard regressions. In this R script, we test out 4 individual distribution pair analysis: Normal, T, Skewed Normal and Skewed T. Then we try several Copula models for fitting and best estimates.
