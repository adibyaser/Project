## The target of this project is to introduce volatility clustering and the importance of AR-GARCH models. Just ARIMA models are not enough to forecast time series data. In this small case study, we justify the need for different models to account for time dependency and volalitility clustering. Finally, taking the random component of two stocks, to account for their dependency structure from their marginals so that we can appropriately estimate their Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Different weights for portfolio weight are tried to see how risky the portfolio becomes. Further improvements will be made later by adding uncertainty. In that case, a nested loop will be necessary.
